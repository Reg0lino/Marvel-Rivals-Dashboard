If her allies are at full health, 70% of the excess healing is converted into bonus health until the Ultimate is over. The over-healing can only give each player up to 100 extra health. Mantis also benefits from the speed boost, healing and over-health, making her much harder to take down. This is the second most powerful healing ability in the game (after Luna Snow's Fate of Both Worlds), being clutch in moments where the team is getting bombarded by enemy fire. It can change the course of the battle, being specially useful to contest objectives since her entire team will be hard to take down even with focused fire.
