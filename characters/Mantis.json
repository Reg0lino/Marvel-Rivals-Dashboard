    "strategy_overview": "<b><u>Overall Playstyle:</u></b><br>\n<p>Mantis is an agile Strategist who relies on generating and expending Life Orbs for healing, damage boosts, and crowd control. Her <b>Life Energy Blast (LMB)</b> grants a Life Orb on critical hits. Her ultimate, <b>Soul Resurgence (Q)</b>, provides AoE burst and sustained healing, a movement speed boost, and converts excess healing to bonus health. <b>Spore Slumber (Shift)</b> puts an enemy to sleep. Consuming Life Orbs, she can use <b>Allied Inspiration (E)</b> for ally damage boost, <b>Natural Anger (F)</b> for self damage boost, or <b>Healing Flower (RMB)</b> for ally HoT.</p>\n<p>Position Mantis in the backline, using her <b>Nature's Favor (Passive)</b> speed boost (when uninjured) to maintain safe distances and land crits for Life Orbs. Balance healing with damage output, often prioritizing <b>Allied Inspiration</b> on Duelists. Use <b>Spore Slumber</b> to disrupt high-priority targets or protect allies. Use her ultimate aggressively for pushes or to counter enemy ultimates. Effectiveness heavily relies on landing crits. She functions best as an off-healer paired with a main healer. Effects of Healing Flower and Allied Inspiration can now stack (up to a max duration).</p><br><br>\n\n<b><u>Key Combos & Ability Usage:</u></b><br>\n<ul>\n  <li><b><u>Disable & Eliminate Combo:</u></b><br>Use <b>Spore Slumber (Shift)</b> to put a high-priority target to sleep â†’ Immediately apply <b>Allied Inspiration (E)</b> to a teammate who can then focus fire on the sleeping enemy for a potential quick elimination.<br><br></li>\n  <li><b><u>Self-Empowered Offense:</u></b><br>Consume a Life Orb with <b>Natural Anger (F)</b> to boost your own damage output. Use this to help secure kills or apply significant pressure on vulnerable targets.<br><br></li>\n  <li><b><u>Ultimate Damage Boost Combo:</u></b><br>Apply <b>Allied Inspiration (E)</b> to a Duelist teammate right before they activate their ultimate ability. This significantly amplifies their damage potential during their ultimate.<br><br></li>\n  <li><b><u>Sustained Healing Support:</u></b><br>Use <b>Healing Flower (RMB)</b> on multiple allies who are taking damage, consuming Life Orbs to provide them with a consistent healing over time effect.<br><br></li>\n  <li><b><u>Ultimate Offensive/Defensive Use (Soul Resurgence - Q):</u></b><br>During a team push, activate your ultimate, then use <b>Natural Anger (F)</b> for self-damage, and spam <b>Allied Inspiration (E)</b> on key damage dealers while continuing to fire <b>Life Energy Blast (LMB)</b> for orb generation and damage/healing.<br><br></li>\n</ul>\n\n<b><u>Matchup Considerations:</u></b><br>\n<ul>\n  <li><b>Favorable Against:</b> Teams with high-damage Duelists (amplifies their output with <b>Allied Inspiration</b>). Opponents vulnerable to hard CC (<b>Spore Slumber</b> can disable many Duelists/Strategists). Teams lacking strong burst healing (her sustained support and damage boosts can provide an edge). Enemy teams with key targets vulnerable to <b>Spore Slumber</b> (e.g., Vanguards, enemy healers).<br><br></li>\n  <li><b>Challenging Against:</b> Teams with strong AoE damage (can hit her in the backline). Heroes with extreme burst damage (may kill before healing reacts). Opponents skilled at denying crits (hinders Life Orb generation). Teams with multiple high-sustain healers. Heroes who can easily reveal her position or counter Spore Slumber (e.g., CC immunity). Her base health was reduced in S2, making her squishier.<br><br></li>\n  <li><b>Key Synergies:</b> Team-Up with <u>Adam Warlock</u> (<b>Nature's Soul</b>) grants both cocooned revival. Best paired with a dedicated main healer.</li>\n</ul><br>\n\n<b><u>Core Strengths:</u></b><br>\n<ul>\n  <li><b>Significant Damage Potential (for a Strategist):</b> Especially with <b>Natural Anger (F)</b> boosting her own damage.</li>\n  <li><b>Powerful Ally Damage Boost:</b> <b>Allied Inspiration (E)</b> provides a substantial damage increase to a targeted ally.</li>\n  <li><b>Effective Hard Crowd Control:</b> <b>Spore Slumber (Shift)</b> can disable key enemy targets with a sleep effect.</li>\n  <li><b>Impactful Team Ultimate:</b> <b>Soul Resurgence (Q)</b> offers AoE healing, HoT, movement speed, and bonus health conversion.</li>\n  <li><b>Enhanced Mobility (Passive):</b> <b>Nature's Favor</b> grants a speed boost when uninjured.</li>\n  <li><b>Resource Generation via Crits:</b> Landing crits with <b>Life Energy Blast (LMB)</b> allows for frequent ability use.</li>\n  <li><b>Stacking Buffs/Heals (S2):</b> <b>Healing Flower</b> and <b>Allied Inspiration</b> effects can now stack up to a max duration.</li>\n  <li><b>Team-Up Survivability:</b> Synergy with <u>Adam Warlock</u> offers mutual revival potential.</li>\n</ul>",
