    "strategy_overview": "Mastering self-defense is crucial, as opponents will try to eliminate you. Practice using Squirrel Blockade to effectively counter high-mobility characters like Spider-Man or Psylock; if you have a Spider-Man on your team, you can use Webbed Acorn. Utilize Squirrel Girl's ultimate frequently, even in 1v1 situations, to gain a tactical advantage, essentially giving your team an extra character on the field for 12 seconds. Exploit environmental awareness by bouncing shots off walls to hit enemies hiding behind cover. When facing flying characters like Storm or Iron Man, use your trap to stun them, bringing them within your attack range. Improve your aim and consistency by practicing in the practice range, focusing on stun-locking flying bots. Provide support to teammates, especially tanks, by firing at their attackers, and coordinate with damage dealers like Iron Fist to secure eliminations. Use Squirrel Blockade or Webbed Acorn to stun enemy tanks that dive into your backline, protecting your team. Prioritize eliminating Loki clones and Anks, as Squirrel Girl can dispatch them quickly, disrupting enemy strategies.",

      "Unbeatable Squirrel Tsunami can be easily avoided, as it only hits ground targets; enemies flying or on high ground won't be affected by it.",
