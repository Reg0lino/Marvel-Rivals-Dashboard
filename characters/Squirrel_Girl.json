Utilize Squirrel Girl's ultimate frequently, even in 1v1 situations, to gain a tactical advantage, essentially giving your team an extra character on the field for 12 seconds. Exploit environmental awareness by bouncing shots off walls to hit enemies hiding behind cover. When facing flying characters like Storm or Iron Man, use your trap to stun them, bringing them within your attack range. Improve your aim and consistency by practicing in the practice range, focusing on stun-locking flying bots. Provide support to teammates, especially tanks, by firing at their attackers, and coordinate with damage dealers like Iron Fist to secure eliminations. Use Squirrel Blockade or Webbed Acorn to stun enemy tanks that dive into your backline, protecting your team. Prioritize eliminating Loki clones and Anks, as Squirrel Girl can dispatch them quickly, disrupting enemy strategies.",

Good work, everybody!\"\nAs Squirrel Girl praised her army of rodent companions for their efforts, the tiny creatures began to chitter with delight. They would do anything for their human friend, Doreen Green — even risk their lives against the seemingly endless throng of nocturnal nightmares that had emerged after an ancient curse trapped New York City in a state of perpetual night.\n\"You've definitely earned a trip to Mr. Hickory's fresh roasted nut cart on the corner of 55th and — \"\nBefore Squirrel Girl could finish that thought, her BFFF — Best Furry Friend Forever — Tippy-Toe scurried past her fellow squirrels and climbed right onto Doreen's shoulder. As Tippy began to chirp into Squirrel Girls' ear, Doreen's ever-present smile dropped a bit.\n\"Wait... that can't be right...\" Squirrel Girl said. \"A giant squirrel... fell out of the sky...? Here in Central Park...? Are you sure, Tippy?\"\nTippy-Toe leapt from Squirrel Girl's shoulder and bolted back towards the heart of the park. Before she disappeared into the woods, she turned around and beckoned for her friend to come along.\n\"Guess Mr. Hickory is gonna have to keep his nuts warm a little longer,\" Squirrel Girl said, shrugging as she followed Tippy-Toe into the dark forest. The rest of the squirrels stayed close behind Doreen, ready to take on whatever threats might be lurking in the shadows.\nAs soon as they reached a clearing, Squirrel Girl realized that Tippy-Toe hadn't been exaggerating in the slightest. There, int he middle of a small impact crater, was the biggest squirrel Doreen had ever seen. Her furry friends surrounded the creature and stared in awe. But something was clearly wrong. The giant rodent was hurt. Bad.\n\"Excuse me... ma'am...?\" Squirrel Girl said cautiously. \"You look like you could use a friend...\"\n\"Aye...\" the enormous squirrel replied, with pain its voice. \"I am so far from home... Yet the scent of this realm seems oddly familiar... Tell me, to where have I fallen, dear child...?\"",

So getting whisked away through some sort of magic portal to a living Mutant island 75 years in the future wasn't exactly on her Bingo card. But she wasn't complaining. After the fight against Dracula, she and her squirrel friends were in desperate need of a vacation. And there was no better place to kick back and relax than on a tropical island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean!",
