    "strategy_overview": "<b><u>Overall Playstyle:</u></b><br>\n<p>Winter Soldier is an aggressive, precise Duelist known for high burst damage and significant crowd control. His primary, <b>Roterstern (LMB)</b>, fires explosive rounds (3 per mag) damaging the initial target and splashing behind them. <b>Bionic Hook (RMB)</b> pulls the first enemy hit (and nearby enemies behind them) towards him (range increased by charging). <b>Trooper's Fist (Shift)</b> dashes forward, seizing enemies and launching them with an uppercut. <b>Tainted Voltage (E - 2 charges S2)</b> is a piercing electrical projectile that damages, slows, and knocks down airborne opponents.</p>\n<p>Position behind Vanguards, capitalizing on space created, and near Strategists for protection against flankers. His ultimate, <b>Kraken Impact (Q)</b>, involves a leap and slam, applying a 'Culling' mark (insta-execute below health threshold, resets ult cooldown on successful cull). His passive, <b>Ceaseless Charge</b>, auto-reloads Roterstern and grants bonus health when using bionic arm abilities. Weave bionic arm abilities between Roterstern shots for ammo and health sustain.</p><br><br>\n\n<b><u>Key Combos & Ability Usage:</u></b><br>\n<ul>\n  <li><b><u>Basic Kill Combo:</u></b><br><b>Bionic Hook (RMB)</b> to pull enemy → Immediately <b>Trooper's Fist (Shift)</b> to dash through and launch → Finish with <b>Roterstern (LMB)</b> shots.<br><br></li>\n  <li><b><u>Anti-Air Combo:</u></b><br>Enemy airborne → Use <b>Tainted Voltage (E)</b> to knock them down → Quickly fire <b>Roterstern (LMB)</b> shots while they are grounded.<br><br></li>\n  <li><b><u>Ultimate Chain Combo (Kraken Impact - Q):</u></b><br>Identify a low-health target → Use <b>Kraken Impact (Q)</b> to leap, slam, and apply Culling mark → Immediately use <b>Roterstern (LMB)</b> to confirm kill and reset ult cooldown. Repeat on other low-health targets.<br><br></li>\n  <li><b><u>Displacement Combo:</u></b><br><b>Bionic Hook (RMB)</b> to pull an enemy out of position → Immediately <b>Trooper's Fist (Shift)</b> to push them further towards your team or away from theirs.<br><br></li>\n  <li><b><u>Mid-Range Harass:</u></b><br>Use <b>Tainted Voltage (E)</b> to slow a retreating enemy → Follow with accurate <b>Roterstern (LMB)</b> shots.<br><br></li>\n</ul>\n\n<b><u>Matchup Considerations:</u></b><br>\n<ul>\n  <li><b>Favorable Against:</b> Squishy Duelists and Strategists (high burst, CC isolates them). Flying heroes (<b>Tainted Voltage</b> knocks down). Tanks without strong shields/mobility (Bionic Hook displaces, abilities hinder).<br><br></li>\n  <li><b>Challenging Against:</b> Long-range, high-damage hitscan (e.g., <u>Hela</u>, <u>Hawkeye</u>) who outrange him. Heroes with strong shields/invulnerability. Agile Duelists with good tracking (e.g., <u>Spider-Man</u>) can be hard to hit consistently. <u>Namor's</u> multiple Monstro spawns can overwhelm.<br><br></li>\n  <li><b>Key Synergies:</b> Team-Up with <u>Captain America</u> (<b>Stars Aligned</b>) grants <b>Stellar Impact</b> (leap to ally, AoE damage) improving mobility and engagement, plus a powerful clash attack.</li>\n</ul><br>\n\n<b><u>Core Strengths:</u></b><br>\n<ul>\n  <li><b>High Burst Damage:</b> Can quickly eliminate vulnerable targets with ability sequences and Roterstern.</li>\n  <li><b>Strong Crowd Control Suite:</b> <b>Bionic Hook (RMB - pull)</b>, <b>Trooper's Fist (Shift - launch)</b>, <b>Tainted Voltage (E - slow/knockdown)</b> provide versatile disruption.</li>\n  <li><b>Kill-Chaining Ultimate:</b> <b>Kraken Impact (Q)</b> can reset on successful culls, enabling multi-kills.</li>\n  <li><b>Sustain via Passive:</b> <b>Ceaseless Charge</b> auto-reloads weapon and grants bonus health on bionic arm ability use.</li>\n  <li><b>Effective Anti-Air:</b> <b>Tainted Voltage (E)</b> reliably grounds flying opponents.</li>\n  <li><b>Good Displacement:</b> Abilities can pull enemies out of position or push them into unfavorable spots.</li>\n  <li><b>Enhanced Utility (S2):</b> Two charges of <b>Tainted Voltage (E)</b> allow for more frequent use.</li>\n  <li><b>Powerful Team-Up:</b> Synergy with <u>Captain America</u> significantly boosts mobility and AoE damage.</li>\n</ul>",
