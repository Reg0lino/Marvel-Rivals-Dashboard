        "title": "Reality Check",
        "content": "Dr. Reed Richards — the renowned scientist and adventurer also known as Mister Fantastic — stood in his laboratory in the Baxter Building, closely examining a small crystal that his best friend, Ben Grimm, had recovered on one of his many excursions into lower Manhattan. Reed had his own theories about the strange energy stored within the glowing shard, but even the most brilliant man in the universe needed a second opinion every now and then. And Reed knew exactly who he had to ask for one: The most brilliant woman in any universe — Shuri, the princess of Wakanda.\n\nNot long after the Timestream Entanglement erupted across the Multiverse, causing realities to collide and collapse, Reed had received an unexpected and urgent message from Wakanda. But it was not from the technologically advanced African nation that Reed  and his fellow members of the Fantastic Four had long called their allies. Instead, this was from a Wakanda located in another dimension, one where King T'Challa had taken his people to the edge of the universe and built a society that spanned the stars.\n\nMuch like in Reed's own reality, T'Challa's sister, Shuri, was the driving force behind the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda's scientific research. So it came to no surprise that she too had been tirelessly searching for a way to undo the damage caused by the Timestream Entanglement. Fortunately, she was not too proud to admit that she could not find the solution alone.\n\nAfter her initial communication was received, Reed and Shuri began to compare notes and hypotheses, bringing other trusted allies like Tony Stark into their fold. Eventually, they were able to build a Timestream Reintegration Device that would theoretically be able to restore the damaged realities to their original state. Of course, finding an energy source potent enough to power the TRD would be nearly impossible, a topic which had since become the source of much debate between the device's creators.\n\nReed knew deep inside that these crystals — which had come to be known as Chronovium by those studying them — were the key. But when compared to the data he had acquired from scanning this shard with recent test results gathered by Shuri, things just weren't adding up. He had to get to the bottom of this... while there was still time left...\n\n\"You wanted to talk, Dr. Richards?\" a voice said from the other side of the computer screen.\n\n\"Ah, Shuri,\" Reed replied, as the screen lit up to reveal the face of his interdimensional ally, \"I'm glad you got my message.\"\n\n\"As always, when the Fantastic Four calls,\" Shuri said, \"Wakanda answers.\"\n\n\"Good. Because answers are what I'm seeking,\" Reed said, getting right to the point. \"We have both previously surmised that Chronovium is a byproduct of the massive fluctuations in energy released by the Timestream Entanglement, correct?\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" Shuri said. \"And it makes me wonder how many other forms may be out there... in whatever universes still remain...\"\n\n\"And that is one of the reasons why I called you,\" Reed said. \"If we could begin to catalog how many other universes—\"\n\n\"Chronoverses,\" Shuri interjected. \"That is what we here in Wakanda are calling the fractured realities created by the Timestream Entanglement.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Reed continued, \"If we could catalog how many other Chronoverses there are out there, perhaps we could get a better understanding of the current state of the Multiverse, as well as the other types of Chronovium that might be at our disposal.\"\n\n\"I have identified at least one other reality beyond our own,\" Shuri responded without hesitation. \"Recently, Captain America arrived here in Wakanda seeking refuge...\"\n\nReed paused for a moment as Shuri spoke. The Captain America he had known had fallen in battle not long ago, and the entire world was still reeling from the loss. Logically, Reed was well aware that every reality likely had it's own variant of Steve Rogers, but knowing that one was currently residing in Wakanda offered a sense of hope that Reed hadn't felt in far too long.\n\n\"Unlike the Captain America that both my father and my brother proudly fought alongside over the years,\" Shuri said, \"this Steven Rogers claimed that he had been frozen during World War II and had not been reawakened until the year 2099.\"\n\n\"That's not the first time I've heard that date mentioned,\" Reed noted. \"Our Spider-Man told me that he was visited by one of his alternate reality counterparts, a young woman who calls herself Spider-Zero. She claimed to be from the year 2099 as well, and asked for his help to repair a Dimensional nexus point known as the Web of Life and Destiny.\"\n\n\"Fascinating,\" Shuri said, taking notes as she talked. \"Based of Captain America's intel, we also believe that this future timeline may be a gathering point for Mutants whose home realities have ceased to exist. His ally, Wolverine, claimed that he resided on a time-displaced island called Krakoa.\"\n\n\"Curious,\" Reed muttered as he pondered Shuri's words. \"Our Krakoa vanished without a trace when the Timestream Entanglement hit us. Could the living island in that Chronoverse be one and the same?\"\n\n\"I will see if Captain America or his allies can coerce Wolverine into sharing any further information,\" Shuri said.\n\n\"Allies?\" Reed asked. \"Steve brought along friends?\"\n\n\"Not quite,\" Shuri said. \"My own Chronoverse has been facing a number of its own challenges of late, including a growing darkness that is spreading rapidly across the star systems. I had initially sent the Guardians of the Galaxy to investigate its origin point on Klyntar, but I have lost contact with them. In order to prepare for whatever may be coming our way, T'Challa and I asked Steven gather some trusted allies from across time and space. Including a few from your own timeline — Hawkeye and the Winter Soldier.\"\n\n\"Interesting,\" Reed said. \"Tony had told me that they both went missing after an incident at a remote Hydra base. He'll be glad they made it out alive.\"\n\n\"I certainly was,\" Shuri responded. \"I believe they will prove to be valuable allies in the days ahead. I fear this darkness is already tainting Wakanda. Even the gods themselves are not safe from its corruptive influence...\"\n\n\"Speaking of the gods...\" Reed said as Shuri's words trailed off, \"...the Asgard in my timeline had become something entirely new. Their World Tree, Yggdrasil, has grown and merged with the golden realm to create Yggsgard. And, according to reports, Loki is already trying to take advantage of the situation.\"\n\n\"No suprise there,\" Shuri said.\n\nBut the Asgardians aren't the only pantheon in disarray,\" Reed continued. \"Stephen Strange recently returned from a trip through the Astral Plane, where he says he communicated with heroes from yet another dimension — one where powerful deities were locked in an endless war for omnipotent power and total control.\"\n\n\"So that gives us at least four Chronoverses then?\" Shuri said, examining her notes.\n\n\"That we've identified thus far, yes,\" Reed replied. \"And as they continue to collapse and intertwine, I have a feeling that they will start to become ever more dependent upon each other for survival.\"\n\n\"With so few timelines left,\" Shuri said, \"we cannot risk losing any of them. That is exactly why my brother chose to pay a visit your world. I hope his delivery proved useful in your efforts.\"\n\n\"T'Challa... came here...?\" Reed said, clearly puzzled. \"When?\"\n\n\"He left Wakanda a week ago,\" Shuri said, her usual calm and collected expression suddenly giving way to one of deep concern. \"I calibrated our cross-dimensional teleporters myself. I am certain he arrived safely in the New York of your reality.\"\n\n\"Arrived safely, perhaps,\" Reed said, dismayed, \"but anything could have happened after that. Our city isn't exactly as safe as it used to be, after all. The curse that locked us in a permanent nocturnal state allowed certain factions that had formerly been relegated to the shadows the opportunity to seize power.\"\n\n\"Vampires,\" Shuri said, fully aware of the problem. \"T'Challa had hoped to offer you a sample of our own Heart-Shaped Herb as a means of developing a cure to this plague. But if he has fallen victim to it... then...\"\n\n\"Don't you worry your majesty,\" Reed responded. \"Like you said, we're in this together. And when Wakanda calls, the Fantastic Four answers, too.\"\n\n\"I just pray to Orisha that we are not too late...\"Shuri said solemnly, \"...for all of our sakes...\"",
