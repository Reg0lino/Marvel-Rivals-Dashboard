  "gameplay": {
    "strategy_overview": "<b><u>Overall Playstyle:</u></b><br>\n<p>Cloak and Dagger are a unique dual-character Strategist, requiring seamless swaps between Dagger (healing focus) and Cloak (damage/utility focus). Dagger sustains with bouncing <b>Lightforce Daggers (LMB)</b>, <b>Veil of Lightforce (E - healing wall)</b>, and <b>Dagger Storm (RMB - healing field)</b>. Cloak offers offensive pressure with <b>Darkforce Cloak (LMB - lock-on beam)</b>, blinds/vulns with <b>Terror Cape (E)</b>, and grants team invulnerability/invisibility with <b>Dark Teleportation (RMB - shroud)</b>. Mastering frequent, strategic swaps is fundamental.</p>\n<p>Dagger typically operates from the backline, providing consistent ranged healing. Cloak's positioning is more fluid, moving to protect allies, engage, or strategically deploy his shroud. <b>Dark Teleportation (shroud)</b> is exceptionally powerful for negating enemy ultimates with precise timing. Their shared ultimate, <b>Eternal Bond (Q)</b>, involves three dashes creating a heal/damage aura, useful for objective pushes and area control. Effective cooldown management across both characters' kits is paramount. Prioritize healing with Dagger as the primary function, using Cloak for strategic damage and utility as situations demand. Swapping to Cloak auto-reloads Dagger's weapon.</p><br><br>\n\n<b><u>Key Combos & Ability Usage:</u></b><br>\n<ul>\n  <li><b><u>Dagger Healing Burst:</u></b><br>Deploy <b>Veil of Lightforce (E)</b> immediately followed by <b>Dagger Storm (RMB)</b>. This provides an initial burst heal from the veil, followed by sustained healing over time from the storm, maximizing healing on a target or group.<br><br></li>\n  <li><b><u>Cloak Debuff to Dagger Damage:</u></b><br>As Cloak, apply <b>Terror Cape (E)</b> to enemies (blind & vulnerability) → Quickly switch to Dagger (LShift) → Follow up with accurate <b>Lightforce Daggers (LMB)</b> to capitalize on debuffed targets.<br><br></li>\n  <li><b><u>Cloak Aggressive Reposition/Shroud:</u></b><br>As Cloak, use <b>Dark Teleportation (RMB)</b> to reposition aggressively into the enemy backline or to shroud key allies during enemy ultimates → Switch back to Dagger (LShift) if healing is needed, or maintain Cloak for pressure.<br><br></li>\n  <li><b><u>Lightforce Dagger (LMB - Dagger) Utility:</u></b><br>Remember these daggers bounce and have a homing effect, allowing healing/damage around corners and on mobile targets. Swapping to Cloak automatically reloads them.<br><br></li>\n  <li><b><u>Dark Teleportation (RMB - Cloak) - Ultimate Negation:</u></b><br>This is a game-changing ability. Time its use precisely to enshroud your team, making them invulnerable and invisible to negate high-impact enemy ultimates (e.g., from <u>Jeff</u>, <u>Iron Man</u>, <u>Magneto</u>, <u>Scarlet Witch</u>, <u>Venom</u>).<br><br></li>\n</ul>\n\n<b><u>Matchup Considerations:</u></b><br>\n<ul>\n  <li><b>Favorable Against:</b> Characters with evasive movement or flight (Dagger's homing daggers track well). Can counter <u>Doctor Strange's</u> dive with Dagger's healing bubble. <u>Invisible Woman</u> (Cloak can lock on/track; Dagger's bubble negates attacks). Teams reliant on predictable ultimates that Cloak's shroud can negate. Brawl compositions with less mobile tanks (<b>Eternal Bond</b> provides good AoE heal/damage).<br><br></li>\n  <li><b>Challenging Against:</b> Splash damage characters (AoE is hard to avoid due to C&D's slower speed). <u>Hulk</u> (his ultimate can counter <b>Eternal Bond</b>). <u>Black Panther</u> (can block Dagger's healing shots). <u>Scarlet Witch</u> (her ultimate can counter <b>Eternal Bond</b>). Heroes with strong area denial or persistent CC can limit mobility and swaps.<br><br></li>\n  <li><b>Key Synergies:</b> Works well with teams that can capitalize on the windows of opportunity created by Cloak's utility (e.g., shroud allowing safe aggression) or Dagger's sustained healing.</li>\n</ul><br>\n\n<b><u>Core Strengths:</u></b><br>\n<ul>\n  <li><b>Versatile Dual Forms:</b> Distinct healer (Dagger) and DPS/utility (Cloak) modes adaptable to team needs.</li>\n  <li><b>Ultimate Negation (Cloak):</b> <b>Dark Teleportation (RMB)</b> can completely negate enemy ultimates with precise timing.</li>\n  <li><b>Auto-Aim Healing (Dagger):</b> <b>Lightforce Daggers (LMB)</b> are forgiving and can bounce, increasing healing reach.</li>\n  <li><b>Strong Healing Output (Dagger):</b> Capable of sustaining teams through prolonged engagements.</li>\n  <li><b>Backline Defense (Cloak):</b> Effective against divers with close-range damage and shroud protection.</li>\n  <li><b>AoE Heal/Damage Ultimate:</b> <b>Eternal Bond (Q)</b> is valuable for team pushes and objective control.</li>\n  <li><b>Independent Cooldowns:</b> Use an ability with one, swap, and immediately use an ability with the other.</li>\n  <li><b>Automatic Reload Mechanic:</b> Swapping to Cloak reloads Dagger's weapon.</li>\n</ul>",
