Dracula had taken Manhattan all for himself, and he wasn't letting any of his human \"playthings\" escape.\nStill Peter came by to look, wishing he could talk to Aunt May, Every Wednesday. That's when he missed Aunt May the most, because ever since he'd moved out of her house, he'd always tried to get back to see her for lunch on Wednesdays.\nToday, he was staying a little farther away from the bridge, watching it from the Midtown Tunnel's ventilation tower, a mile downstream past the U.N. headquarters. It was a quiet place for contemplation, since the huge fans were no longer running. He had cased the area for vampires before letting himself have his weekly moment of regret and longing for a world before the Timestream Entanglement. Before the vampires had taken over New York. Before he had lost track of the days since he'd seen the sun. [rest of story omitted for brevity]",
