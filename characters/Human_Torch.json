When Supernova is activated, Human Torch should focus on concentrating its Flame Tornadoes on non-Vanguards to knock them out quickly allowing the entire team to take on the lone Vanguards.\nHuman Torch can easily counter when Punisher sets up his Culling Turret by throwing Flame Fields around him providing rapid damage per second to him which can further be depleted by activating Pyro Prison or hitting a Flaming Meteor when the health is very low.",

Instead, he became one, gaining power and popularity as a member of the world famous Fantastic Four.

    "hero_stories": [
      {
        "title": "Fire Exemption Test",
        "content": "Johnny Storm saw a vampire sulking along the edge of Bryant Park, and did what he always did on such an occasion: Lit it up like a Roman candle. Then he saw another one, trying to get away around the corner onto Fifth Avenue. Boom, that one was gone too. He did this every night - or every day, it was hard to tell what time it was in Dracula’s New York, because the sun never came up and the moon always hung low and red seemingly right over Grand Central. Either way, the Human Torch kept the area near Baxter Building as free of vampires as he could. That meant a lot of vampires had gone up in smoke because of him, and that in turn meant that Johnny Storm was currently Number One on Dracula’s hit list. The vampire-in-chief had sent some of his top lieutenants after Johnny, veterans of the Cult of the Darkholders, but either Johnny had lit them up too, or he’d gotten away before they could get a bite on him.\nVampires couldn’t bite you when you were made of superheated plasma.\nThat was one reason why he went out on these patrols every day. He was safer than more New Yorkers from the threat of vampires, which made him especially well suited to vampire population control, especially in the area around the Baxter Building, which was uncomfortably close to Dracula’s castle. Johnny did this because he didn’t want vampires around the Baxter Building, but also because he knew that smoking so many vampires right around the castle - where Dracula would watch - was like waving a big old middle finger at the vampire lord. He might have stopped time and imprisoned New York in a weird eternal blood moon night, but that didn’t mean New Yorkers were just going to give up.\nJohnny stayed in the air, heading south on Madison to make sure no masses of undead monsters were gathering in that direction. Also he thought\nBen Grimm\nwas doing his own sweeps of the section of Park Avenue south of Dracula’s castle. Probably vampires couldn’t bite Ben either, but Johnny wanted to make sure. They couldn’t afford to lose him. There were so many vampires, so many monsters, and not nearly enough super heroes left to defend the innocent from them.\nBlade\nwas around,\nMoon Knight\n, the\nScarlet Witch\n...pretty quickly, Johnny ran out of names.\nOh. There was also\nSpider-Man\n, of course. One of Johnny’s oldest friends, he stayed to fight vampires, but he also was dying to get back across the East River and see about Aunt May in Queens. New York wouldn’t be New York without him.\nJohnny decided to angle over to Park and see if Ben was staying out of trouble. He hadn’t seen any vampires in a few blocks. As he swooped diagonally over the shadowed buildings lining Park Avenue, he heard an echoing boom and saw a column of smoke blast upward from the center of the street. As it cleared, Johnny saw something so crazy  that it took him a minute to convince himself it was actually real.\nThe creature that tore its way up through the street was a midnight blue in color, maybe ten times the size of an elephant, had three-digit pincers instead of hands, and moved like a dinosaur in an old stop-motion monster movie. It was one of the Deviant Mutates the FF had run into on their first mission together, way back when. Mole Man had a whole stable of bizarre creatures ready to unleash on the world. Johnny remembered this one because it was made of stone, but somehow still moved. Kind of like Ben Grimm, now that he thought about it. And now here it was tearing a huge hole in Park Avenue, revealing a destroyed subway tunnel below, and a cavern below that.\nAs he got a better look at it, Johnny realized that something was different about it, and its surprise appearance suddenly makes a lot more sense.\nIts eyes, he saw, burned with the empty glow you saw in lower-level vampires, the minions Dracula and the other more powerful vampires created at will.\nSo not only was it a giant rock monster, Johnny thought; it was a giant vampire rock monster. Clearly Dracula was sick of just throwing more and more humanoid vampires at Johnny. He’d decided to take a different track.\nThis was a problem. Johnny couldn’t burn it, so he wasn’t sure at first how to fight back as the creature smashed its way up Madison Avenue toward the Baxter Building.\nIt bared stony fangs and snapped at Johnny, who veered out of the way, streaking its side with fire to no effect. Holy smokes, he thought, was it a vampire now too?\n”How did they even bite this thing?” Johnny wondered out loud. It was made of stone. If he couldn’t burn it, how could a vampire bite it?\nThe creature swiped at Johnny, missed, and brought its gigantic pincers down on the street hard enough that manhole covers up and down Madison Avenue flew up into the air like giant spinning coins.\nFrom the corner of 33rd, Ben Grimm charged into view. “Torch, ya just draw trouble wherever ya go,” he growled. “Vampires ain’t bad enough?”\n”This one’s a vampire too!” Johnny called back as the creature bared stone fangs and snapped at Ben. The Thing swatted its jaws to the side and tried to stomp it back into the hole it had made.\n”Crazy!” he shouted. “This town’s gone ta heck in a handbasket since Dracula came along.”\nThe monster shook Ben off and tried to spring on him, but for a guy made out of rocks, Ben Grimm was fairly nimble. He got out of the way. “What are we gonna do about it?”\nThis was a good question. Johnny couldn’t burn it, so the best thing they could do was what Ben was trying to do: Put it back in its hole and make sure it didn’t come out again.\nThe monster snapped at Johnny again as he swooped close, harrying it - and it might have gotten him, too, if a taut cable of spider-webbing hadn’t thwipped out of nowhere and pulled its head to the side.\n”Hey, Torch!” Spider-Man called out as he swung into view. “My Spidey-Sense has been tingling like crazy for the last ten minutes. Now I know why.”\n”You’re just in time,” Johnny answered l, as he distracted the monster again by swooping close to its snapping jaws - and then narrowly avoiding its pincers, which stabbed through the air where he’d been just a second before. “Get some webs on it, Pete! I’m going to dive under it.”\n”You’re gonna what?” the Thing echoed incredulously.\n”Easy,” Johnny said. “Pete gets it hanging over the hole, I get underneath it, then break the webs and I’ll help it down the hole.”\n”From underneath?” the Thing echoed again.\n”Trust me!” Johnny said as he dodged another pincer.\n”I can’t break my webs,” Spider-Man said. “They’re too strong.”\n”Can I?” the Thing asked. “Don’t remember even trying.”\n”Maybe?” Spider-Man wondered. “I’d hate to plan on it, you know?”\n”Yeah.” Johnny had a thought. “Ben, if you can’t break the webs, you can just tear off the part of the building they’re stuck to, right?”\n“Sure,” Ben said. “But you forgot one thing. I can’t climb like him,” jutting a rocky thumb at Spider-Man, “and I can’t fly like you.”\nJohnny glanced over at Spider-Man, and saw that Pete was reaching the same conclusion he was. “I think we can work around that,” he said.\n”Aw, no,” Ben said. “I don’t wanna-“\nBut Spider-Man had already snapped a web onto his back and started swinging him up into the air. More webs followed, binding the monster to the upper corners of buildings on both sides of Park Avenue, so it hung in the middle, half-in and half-out of the hole it had made.\nHere was the part part, Johnny thought. He had to get the monster to stay in one place, and the best way to do that was to offer himself up as bait. So he dove underneath it, and the monster pounced. Both of its pincers clamped down on Johnny, not hurting him much but keeping him pinned as the monster bared its fangs. Here’s where he would find out if he was right that vampires couldn’t bite superheated plasma, Johnny thought.\nHe focused and felt his temperature get hotter. Then hitter still. Then so hot that the subway tracks and the concrete pillars inside the ruined station started to buckle. “Now, Ben!” he shouted again.\nUp above, Ben Grimm tore Spider-Man’s web away from its anchor on the corner of the office tower. Maybe a cubic yard of brick and concrete came with it, tumbling down to crash onto the monster’s stone carapace.\nAnd Johnny Storm went nova.\nThe vast mass of the stone monster blocked most of the nova blast from surfing upward and out onto the street. The blast wave radiated downward into the tunnel carved by the stone Deviant on its way up from the deep caves where it originated, melting stone along with the reinforced concrete of the subway tunnel.\nThe monster couldn’t burn, but the shock of the nova blast stunned it and let Johnny break free. He streaked up out of the hole as it collapsed over the monster, which tumbled into the bottomless cavern it had crawled out of just a few minutes before. Molten asphalt, steel, and stone sealed the hole, cooling quickly into a huge pit in the middle of Park Avenue.\nWhew, Johnny thought. “Flame off,” he said, and dropped to the street. Ben lowered into view on the end of one of Spider-Man’s webs.\n”This is humiliatin’,” he said.\n”Couldn’t have done it without you, Benjy,” Johnny grinned.\nAs the Thing’s feet hit the pavement, Spider-Man swung down and landed next to him. “Pretty neat trick,” he said.\n”Yeah, not bad,” Johnny said. “All about the teamwork.”\n”Who ever heard of a vampire rock monster?” Ben was looking at the pit. Then his wonderment was replaced by his typical pessimism. “It might come up again, ya know.”\nJohnny looked down at the wreckage, the up Park Avenue towards Dracula’s castle. “Yeah,” he said. “I know. This isn’t a war we’re going to win tonight. But it is a war we’re going to win.”\nThe longer he looked at Dracula’s castle, the more Johnny imagined he could see Dracula looking back at him, cold and angry at the failure of his latest scheme to extinguish the Human Torch once and for all.\nHe loved it. “Come and get me,” he dared the distant vampire lord. “If you’ve got the guts.”",
