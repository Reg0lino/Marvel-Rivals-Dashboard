  "gameplay": {
    "strategy_overview": "<b><u>Overall Playstyle:</u></b><br>\n<p>Invisible Woman is a highly effective strategist, excelling with substantial healing, versatile crowd control, and a game-changing ultimate. Her primary fire, <b>Orb Projection (LMB)</b>, uniquely heals allies and damages enemies on both outward and return paths, piercing all targets. <b>Guardian Shield (RMB)</b> provides targeted HoT and a damage-blocking barrier. <b>Psionic Vortex (Shift)</b> offers AoE damage, slow, and a pull. <b>Force Physics (E)</b> can push or pull enemies. She has two invisibility forms: <b>Veiled Step (double jump)</b> and <b>Covert Advance (passive after disengaging)</b> for mobility and survivability.</p>\n<p>Typically, position near your Vanguards for consistent healing with your limited-range <b>Orb Projection</b>, but stay behind the main frontline. Utilize cover and high ground. Prioritize healing and protection, but leverage <b>Psionic Vortex</b> and <b>Force Physics</b> for impactful disruptions and securing eliminations. Her ultimate, <b>Invisible Boundary (Q)</b>, creates a large field that rapidly heals allies, makes them undetectable to outsiders, and slows enemies. This can be delayed after activation for precise timing. Remember invisibility breaks on attack or taking damage. Guardian Shield can be redeployed without cooldown if it has health remaining; recalling it initiates a cooldown reduced by remaining shield health.</p><br><br>\n\n<b><u>Key Combos & Ability Usage:</u></b><br>\n<ul>\n  <li><b><u>Crowd Control Combo:</u></b><br>Use <b>Psionic Vortex (Shift)</b> to pull enemies closer and slow them, grouping them up for focused fire from your team.<br><br></li>\n  <li><b><u>Enhanced Crowd Control Combo:</u></b><br>Use <b>Force Physics (E - Push)</b> to push enemies directly into your already deployed <b>Psionic Vortex (Shift)</b>, maximizing its damage and slow effects.<br><br></li>\n  <li><b><u>Guardian Shield (RMB) Support:</u></b><br>Place on an engaging teammate for damage protection and healing. Simultaneously use <b>Orb Projection (LMB)</b> to further heal them and damage their target.<br><br></li>\n  <li><b><u>Evasive Maneuver/Repositioning:</u></b><br>Double jump (Space) to activate <b>Veiled Step</b> for a burst of invisibility. Use this for surprise flanks, escaping danger, or safely repositioning.<br><br></li>\n  <li><b><u>Force Physics (E) Utility:</u></b><br>Use Push to create space or interrupt abilities. Use Pull to bring enemies out of position or into environmental hazards. Effective ranges differ: Push (12m), Pull (7m).<br><br></li>\n  <li><b><u>Melee Weave (Advanced):</u></b><br>While channeling <b>Orb Projection (LMB)</b>, you can weave in melee attacks (V key) for extra close-range damage without fully interrupting the orb's path, though this requires practice.<br><br></li>\n</ul>\n\n<b><u>Matchup Considerations:</u></b><br>\n<ul>\n  <li><b>Favorable Against:</b> Dive characters like <u>Spider-Man</u> and <u>Black Panther</u> (evasiveness and Force Push disrupt them). Can counter <u>Doctor Strange's</u> ultimate with invisibility and interrupt his Eye of Agamotto with Force Push. Can disrupt <u>Rocket Raccoon's</u> positioning with Force Push. Effective in grouped team compositions and on maps with chokepoints.<br><br></li>\n  <li><b>Challenging Against:</b> Splash damage characters (can hit her behind her team). <u>Doctor Strange's</u> abilities that block healing. <u>Rocket Raccoon's</u> turrets (can spot her while invisible). Heroes with strong area denial. Skilled snipers like <u>Hawkeye</u> if invisibility isn't used wisely. Her Guardian Shield was nerfed (250 HP from 300), making it less durable.<br><br></li>\n  <li><b>Key Synergies:</b> Works well with teams that can capitalize on her area control and the opportunities created by <b>Invisible Boundary</b>. Particularly good for healing flying characters with Guardian Shield.</li>\n</ul><br>\n\n<b><u>Core Strengths:</u></b><br>\n<ul>\n  <li><b>High Healing Output:</b> Capable of sustaining her team through significant damage.</li>\n  <li><b>Dual Function Primary Fire:</b> <b>Orb Projection (LMB)</b> simultaneously heals allies and damages enemies, piercing targets.</li>\n  <li><b>Strong Crowd Control:</b> <b>Psionic Vortex (Shift)</b> (AoE slow/pull) and <b>Force Physics (E)</b> (push/pull) offer versatile disruption.</li>\n  <li><b>Game-Changing Ultimate:</b> <b>Invisible Boundary (Q)</b> provides massive AoE healing, team invisibility, and enemy slows.</li>\n  <li><b>Excellent Evasiveness:</b> Two forms of invisibility (<b>Veiled Step</b> & <b>Covert Advance</b>) make her hard to pin down.</li>\n  <li><b>Targeted Shielding & Healing:</b> <b>Guardian Shield (RMB)</b> offers reliable protection and HoT to a single ally.</li>\n  <li><b>Ability Interruption:</b> <b>Force Physics</b> can interrupt certain enemy ultimates and abilities.</li>\n  <li><b>Effective with Grouped Teams:</b> AoE abilities shine when teams are clustered or in chokepoints.</li>\n</ul>",
