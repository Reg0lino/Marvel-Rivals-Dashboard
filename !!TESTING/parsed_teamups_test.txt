## Team-Up: Atlas Bond

It didn't matter if this popular idol was the same ally he had from the Agents of Atlas, because Lin Lie was no longer the legendary Sword Master of old. But now wasn't the time to dwell on the past. To uphold the long-lost Atlas spirit, they needed to harmonize their efforts like before. With perfect timing, they unleashed their Chi and ice energy together, and in that explosive moment, the two energies fused flawlessly! The colossal force launched the training robot, propelling it several meters into the air!

Seol Hee's cool touch keeps Jeff in high spirits when he's missing the water. Together, they cheer one another up in the toughest of times with friendly snowball fights, though their foes tend to not like playing with ice as much as they do.

Peter never thought he'd run into a fellow Empire State University alumnus among the Super Hero crowd.
