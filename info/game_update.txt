Greetings, Rivals!
We trust you've received your exclusive invitation to the illustrious Hellfire Gala! The excitement is electric as everyone gears up to head to Krakoa for this extraordinary event! So, don your finest attire, and let's dive into the thrilling new content and captivating surprises that await you!
**Maintenance will begin on
April 11 at 2:00 AM PDT
and is expected to take approximately
2-3 hours
. During this time, the servers will be offline, and players will not be able to access the game. Server return times may vary based on progress.
1. New Content
1.1 All Platforms
Heroes and Costumes
1. Emma Frost makes her dazzling debut in Marvel Rivals!
2. New Costumes: Emma Frost - X-Revolution & Blue Sapphire!
Maps and Modes

2. Map Rotation Update: Hellfire Gala: Krakoa will enter the Competitive pool, while Yggsgard: Royal Palace and Tokyo 2099: Shin-Shibuya will be retired from ranked play. Tournament maps will align with the competitive mode, while Quick Match and Custom Game will still feature all maps without rotation.
3. Optimized the settlement logic for substitute players in Quick Match battles: victories will count normally, while losses will not affect combat history or scoreboard.

Ranked
1. Rank Reset: based on your final Season 1.5 rank, ranks will be demoted by 9 divisions. For example, if you ended Season 1.5 at Diamond I, your Season 2 journey begins at Silver I.
2. New rank rewards are in! A dazzling new costume for reaching Gold â Emma Frost - Golden Diamond, along with new Crests of Honor for Grandmaster, Celestial, Eternity, and Top 500.
3. The minimum level required for new players to participate in Competitive has been adjusted to 15. (If you have previously completed at least one valid competitive match, you can still join Competitive in Season 2.0 even if you are below level 15.)
4. Pick/ban will now come into play starting from Gold III rather than Diamond tier.
5. When a team includes players from Eternity or One Above All, only solo or duo queuing will be allowed.
6. Currently, the score you earn per Competitive match is determined by both the outcome and your individual performance. After Season 2.0 launches, we will be increasing the weight of individual performances. The better you perform, the more points you will earn in victory, and the fewer points you will lose in defeat.
Tournament Updates

1.2 PC
Graphics and Settings

When activated, shaders will only compile the first time you launch the game after a new version or graphics driver update. This feature can significantly reduce memory usage and minimize in-game stuttering. âEspecially on systems with 16 GB of RAM or less.
However, if you're using a CPU with less threads in combination with AMD FSR3 Frame Generation, you may notice occasional additional stutters with this feature enabled.

â¦ Trigger Deadzone Settings: Players can now define the trigger depth required for activation.
â¦ New Player Initial Settings Feature: First-time players will receive a reminder of default sensitivity settings, vibration, and trigger effects upon entering the game, making their introduction as smooth as a Super Hero landing.
â¦ Focus Memory Optimization: The focus feature has been upgraded to intelligently remember the last position on the screen.
2. Fixes and Optimizations

â¦ Cloak & Dagger's Form Flaw: Fixed an issue where Cloak or Dagger sometimes left their character model lingering for a brief moment during form switches. Now, they'll slip into action smoother than a stealthy shadow.
â¦ Iron Fist's Floating Fumble: Resolved a rare glitch where Iron Fist could end up floating indefinitely. The Immortal Weapon is now back on the ground, delivering justice and martial arts mastery without any unintended levitation!
â¦ Wolverine's Ferocious Leap: Fixed a rarely occurring issue where Wolverine's Feral Leap could leave him stuck in an abnormal state, unable to finish the move. Now, Logan can unleash his claws with confidence, ensuring his foes don't get a second to breathe!
