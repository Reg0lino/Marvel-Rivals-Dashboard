Dear Rivals,
A new map will be added at the coming first half of season 2 -- Hellfire gala: Krakoa. Let's have a full view of it!
The 2099 Hellfire Gala is underway, and Emma Frost is dazzling in her finery, expertly mingling with the crowd. With guests being properly entertained and the Mutantsâ guards down, the timing is perfect for Ultron to crash this invite-only event! Itâs up to the Quiet Council to get these unruly invaders under control, and their guests safe.
Move with grace and precision across the Gala to stop the imminent infection being spread by Ultron and his robots.
Can you keep your cool and elegance in the face of disaster?
